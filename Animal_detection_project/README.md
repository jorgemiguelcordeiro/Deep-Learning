This project aims to develop a deep learning-based computer vision model capable of accurately 
predicting the species of an animal from an input image. Leveraging convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs), which are particularly built for image classification tasks, the model is trained 
on a diverse dataset of animal images representing multiple species. The primary goal is to enable 
rapid and automated species identification, reducing the reliance on manual observation and 
expert intervention. 

We applied a structured pipeline starting with exploratory data analysis to understand our dataset 
characteristics and inform subsequent decisions. Next, we implemented preprocessing steps to 
clean the data by removing noisy images and created synthetic images to address class imbalance 
and expand our training set. For the modeling phase, our methodology began with handcrafted 
convolutional neural networks before transitioning to transfer learning with pre-trained models to 
enhance results.
